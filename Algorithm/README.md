# Algorithm Details

In this section, we delve into the technical details of the algorithm we've proposed for our Terahertz-Based CO2 Emission Monitoring System. Our approach utilizes Terahertz range frequencies to monitor CO2 emissions by leveraging the IR absorption properties of CO2 and other toxic gases.

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Transmitting Terahertz Signals:**
   - We transmit Terahertz signals within a specific frequency range with pre-defined power.
   - Two signals are transmitted: one around a wavelength of 15,000nm, affected by both CO2 and water vapor, and another around a wavelength of 40,000nm, affected only by water vapor.

2. **Receiving and Analyzing Signals:**
   - Multiple receivers are placed at various locations within the monitored area.
   - The receivers capture the transmitted signals and measure power loss or concentration loss.
   - We calculate the deviation in relevant parameters, such as power loss or concentration loss of the transmitted signal.

3. **Calculating CO2 Concentration:**
   - Using the deviation and statistical analysis, we calculate the CO2 and toxic gases concentration in the monitored area.
   - By taking repetitive measurements from different receivers, we can calculate the mean concentration over the specific area.

## Overcoming Challenges

### Addressing Water Vapor Interference:
- Water vapor is more abundant than CO2 and can also absorb IR rays.
- To mitigate this, we conducted an analysis of IR wavelengths affected by both CO2 and water vapor.
- Our solution transmits signals at two distinct wavelengths, allowing us to separate CO2-affected signals from those affected only by water vapor.

### Handling Channel Impairments:
- Although our algorithm is conceptually straightforward, practical implementation requires addressing challenges like distortion, attenuation, and interference.
- We have conducted experiments and collected statistical data to understand the relationship between signal transmission and reception under real-world conditions.

## Technology and Platform

Our chosen technology stack for implementing the Terahertz-Based CO2 Emission Monitoring System includes:

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi
- **Software**: Advanced computer vision techniques and aided programs for mathematical solutions.

## Further Implementation

As we refine our system, we plan to explore the following enhancements:

- **Mobile Application**: Develop a mobile app that provides localized atmospheric information, making it easier for users to access and understand the data.
- **Global Gas Concentration Detection**: With the success of our local monitoring system, we envision extending our solution to detect gas concentrations globally by transmitting signals using relevant satellites.

By continually advancing our technology and refining our algorithms, we aim to provide an effective and comprehensive solution for monitoring CO2 emissions in various environments.
