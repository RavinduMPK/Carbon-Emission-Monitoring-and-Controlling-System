# Terahertz-Based CO2 Emission Monitoring System

Welcome to the repository for our Terahertz-Based CO2 Emission Monitoring System project proposal. In this proposal, we address the pressing issue of greenhouse gas emissions, focusing on CO2, and present an innovative monitoring solution utilizing Terahertz range frequencies.

## Problem Definition

Nowadays, the greenhouse effect has become a major concern due to the emissions of CO2 and toxic gases, resulting in a drastic increase in greenhouse emissions. This trend is evident in the increasing CO2 emissions graph, highlighting the urgency of the situation. Sri Lanka, like many places, is also grappling with significant CO2 emissions.

The lack of proper monitoring systems for emissions contributes to this undesirable situation. CO2 concentration changes considerably in indoor areas, making it crucial to detect these changes promptly and efficiently. However, current monitoring systems are often limited in scope and effectiveness.

## Analysis

The data shows that in outdoor areas, CO2 concentration remains relatively stable, whereas indoors, it can experience significant fluctuations. This discrepancy highlights the need for a robust monitoring solution that can accurately and consistently detect CO2 concentration changes in both environments.

## Solution

Our proposed solution leverages Terahertz range frequencies to monitor CO2 emissions effectively. Unlike traditional CO2 sensors, which are often point-based and limited in coverage, our system utilizes the IR absorption properties of CO2 and other toxic gases to provide a broader and more comprehensive monitoring capability.

## Product Overview and Uniqueness

Our system capitalizes on Terahertz communication's advantages, extending its bandwidth and leveraging CO2's IR absorption properties. Unlike existing CO2 sensors limited to small areas, our approach covers larger spaces, offering more comprehensive monitoring capabilities. Our aim is to not only detect but also alert organizations about sudden CO2 concentration changes.

## Business Model and Marketing Plan

We outline a strategic business model that starts with an indoor monitoring system for industrial factories. We iterate based on feedback, gradually expanding to more customers. Our goal is to gather data and improve our product for the local and foreign markets. We also plan to introduce an outdoor monitoring system with higher coverage after initial success.

## Technical Overview and Implementation

### Algorithm
- We use Terahertz frequencies to measure CO2 concentration based on IR absorption.
- Transmit two signals: one affected by CO2 and water vapor, and another affected by water vapor alone.
- Multiple receivers capture signals, and statistical analysis calculates mean CO2 concentration.

### Challenges
- Addressing interference from water vapor absorption.
- Managing channel impairments, distortion, and attenuation.

### Technology and Platform
- Raspberry Pi and advanced computer vision techniques.
- Future implementation includes a mobile app for localized atmospheric information.

## Technical Limitation

Due to technical limitations in designing and procuring Terahertz range antennas, physical implementation of the system is not feasible. However, the proposal outlines a robust conceptual framework.
